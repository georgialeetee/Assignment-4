<br>Dear reader,</br>
<br>(yes you, one person who accidentally found this website trying to look up
the state or country of Georgia and landed here instead) </br>
I am a 21 year old design student living in Berlin who struggles immensely with programming websites 
so this is an attempt at trying to bring some of my most recent work
onto the platform of the interwebs.

<br>My prospective creative life started about 4 years ago when I spent the summer in Paris with Parsons the New School for Design, 
learning about the basics of product, graphic and fashion design. </br>

<br>After that experience I knew which direction my life after high school would take. 
I spent most of my time illustrating and dove into the fashion world, learning about design and marketing techniques however
this ended up seeming too shallow and pressure-filled. Having to come up with brilliant garments on the spot and
being able to produce them at the drop of a hat didn't seem like the dream I would want to come true. </br>
More often than not I would meet a creative block when trying to fill up my fashion portfolio, so I found a discipline
that connected my love of writing with creation which was layout and graphic design. 
While searching for a possible place to study I found a college offering classes in communication design, which 
seemed like the perfect choice. 
So now I've been a communication design student for almost a year who is now trying to figure out the scary world of web creation. 

<br>Please bear with me while this platform takes shape from empty page to "Georgia Website Land". </br>

<br>'Kay bye, one reader </br>
